As a professional, you will constantly need to self-assess how efficiently you are learning, what you need to learn, and where your knowledge and competency gaps are. Here is your first assessment.

These are the main learning objectives and competencies that you need to assess at this point.

* I have solid vocabulary to correctly explain the the invocation of a function and providing arguments
* I can set breakpoints in my code to pause its execution
* I can evaluate the value of variables using the debugger
* I can execute my code with the **Step Over** and **Step Into** features of the debugger
* I can iterate the items in an array with a `for..of` loop
* I can identify when I need to write conditional logic with an `if` statement
* I can write an `if` statement with correctly syntax

{{< tip "warning" >}}
If you asses that you are lacking in any of these objectives or competencies, discuss them with a coach. It is not the job of your professional coach to identify your learning goals - it is your job.

We will help you devise effective strategies to achieve your learning goals.
