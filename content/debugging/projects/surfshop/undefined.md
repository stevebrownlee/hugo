## Setup



1. Run the following command in your terminal. It will automatically create a directory for you, create a file in that directory named `undefined.js`, and take you to that directory.
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL {{< siteurl >}}debugging/scripts/undefined.sh)"
   ```
2. Open the directory in VS Code with the `code .` command.
3. Open the `undefined.js` file.
4. Run the code with your debugger.

You will immediately see a stack trace in the **Debug Console** at the bottom. Your job is understand the error message, read the stack trace to determine exactly where the error is, and then fix the error.

Run the debugger every time you change the code to see if you have fixed the error.

There are several errors in this code, so you must use your debugger to examine the values of your variables and parameters to help you understand why the error is occurring.

## Final Output

Once you have debugged and fixed all of the errors, you should see the following outout in the **Debug Console**.
