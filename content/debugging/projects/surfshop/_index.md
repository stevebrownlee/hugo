In this project, you will be given code that another developer has written. Each module will be riddled with errors. You will use your invetigative powers with the debugger to find, understand, and fix each one.

This is a professional development project. Your primary responsibility as a new software developer on any team will be to familiarize yourself with the system by investigating, understanding, communicating, and fixing existing bugs.
