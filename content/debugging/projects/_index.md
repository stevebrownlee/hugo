In this book of the course, you will be working on four projects.

1. [Her Majesty, The Queen](queen/) is the first project where you learn how to use the debugger tools in Visual Studio Code and you practice the basic syntax of JavaScript.
2. [Sequina's Surf Shop](surfshop/) is a project where you are given code to run that has errors already in it. You will use your debugger to find, understand, and fix those errors.
