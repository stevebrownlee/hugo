A debugger is a tool that allows you to pause the execution of your code, inspect the state of the program, and step through the code line by line to understand how the program is executing. This is especially useful for beginners because it allows them to understand what is happening in their code at a deeper level and can help them find and fix bugs more efficiently.


For example, if you are working on a program and it is not producing the expected output, you can use a debugger to pause the execution of the program and inspect the variables and their values at different points in the code. This can help you understand why the program is not behaving as expected and allow you to identify and fix the issue.



Additionally, using a debugger can help beginners understand the flow of their code and how different parts of the program interact with each other. This can be especially helpful for those who are new to programming and are still learning how to think about problem solving and design solutions.

Overall, learning to use a debugger is an important skill for beginners to develop because it can help them write more efficient and effective code and become better problem solvers.
