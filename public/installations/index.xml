      <description>Prerequisites First ensure that you have hugo installed.
You need a recent extended version (we recommend version 0.61 or later) of Hugo to do local builds and previews of sites (like this one) that uses this theme.
If you install from the release page, make sure to get the extended Hugo version, which supports sass; you may need to scroll down the list of releases to see it.
For comprehensive Hugo documentation, see gohugo.</description>

Let&#39;s sync your site with forestry CMS.
Prerequisites !! Obviously you ought to have a github account. This is where your website source will live. Basically, forestry will read from github and write (commmit) to your github repo.</description>

      <description>This theme is primarily meant for documentation.
Documentation By default, the theme will look for all your documentation content within the docs directory.
However, if you would like to have your docs content across multiple directories, please list those directories inside config/_default/params.toml under docSections like so:
... docSections = [&amp;#34;docs&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;tutorials&amp;#34;] ... Unlike other regular pages, the documentation pages will have a left sidebar. This sidebar will list links to all the pages in the documentation pages.</description>

      <title>Shortcodes</title>

      <description>Instead of writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes.
Why shortcodes? While markdown is sufficient to produce simple pages, it&#39;s insufficient where complex page structures are needed. Thusly, whenever we need special styling, shortcodes compliment the shortcomings of markdown.
This way, you can side step complex html and css boilerplate in your content files.
Sometimes, the shortcode will wrap content, sometimes it won&#39;t. When content is wrapped, a closing shortcode tag is needed.</description>

      <description>Firstly, ensure you have these lines inside your config.toml file
1[outputs] 2 home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;RSS&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Compose implements fuse.js to enable search functionality. At the time of this writing, search on these theme takes either of this forms:
1. Passive search This occurs only when the user loads the search page i.e /search/. They can directly navigate to that url. Alternatively, the user can type you search query on the search field and click enter.</description>

      <description>Mermaid is library that helps you generate diagrams, flowcharts, and piecharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.
With compose theme, you can use mermaid using a custom shortcode as follows:
Sequence Diagrams Syntax
1{{&amp;lt; mermaid &amp;gt;}} 2sequenceDiagram 3 participant Alice 4 participant Bob 5 Alice-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Hello John, how are you? 6 loop Healthcheck 7 John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Fight against hypochondria 8 end 9 Note right of John: Rational thoughts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;prevail... 10 John--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Alice: Great!</description>

      <description>Using chart js library you can display data you have stored in a csv file as a pie chart, bar graph or doughnut chart.
At this point if you want to display data from a json or yaml file, you would need to convert it into csv first. Else the template will error out.
Once you have a csv file, you display the charts as follows:
Show a pie, doughnut &amp;amp; bar chart at once Firstly define the data you want to display from the front matter:</description>
